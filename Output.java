public class Output{
    public static void main (String args[]){
        System.out.println("Hello World");// ln will print it in diff line same canbe achieved with \n
        System.out.print("Hello World\n");
        System.out.print("Hello World");//now this will be printed together
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.out.print("I am esha. \n I am 19");
    }
}


//println is for 2 diff line/statement
/*but \n works for same statement too 
    ex: print("I am esha. \n I am 19")*/
